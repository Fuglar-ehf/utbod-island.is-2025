# Personal Representative

## About

A service responsible for storing and maintaining personal representatives and their rights to act on behalf of represented individuals.

## Context

The Personal Representative Database and Service API, provided by the Ministry of Social Affairs, manage rights definitions and connections for personal representatives. This ensures digital services can allow representatives to access client information per their authorized rights.

### Example Connections

| **Personal Representative** | **Represented Person** | **Rights**                                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1122334459                  | 1223455569             | health-data, personal-data, limited-financial-data |
| 1020304059                  | 0203050569             | limited-health-data                                |

### Service Provider Usage

Digital service providers do not directly access the service API. They can:

- Set up X-Road and use the [PublicAPI](https://docs.devland.is/apps/services/auth/personal-representative-public)
- Use [Digital Icelandâ€™s](https://www.notion.so/Identity-Server-Integration-afde614a247e4b9da4731b2ace1115cd) login option for Personal Representatives, mapping rights to scopes for client access.

## Development
