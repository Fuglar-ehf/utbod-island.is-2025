## Delegation API

### Overview

The Delegation API is an internal API designed for managing delegation within the Delegation System of the Service Portal.

### Getting Started

To run the API locally, you have the option of connecting to the AWS development database or running a database container locally. For detailed instructions on setting up the database, please refer to the [Getting Started section in the IDS API documentation](../ids-api/README.md#getting-started).

Once the database is operational, you can start the service using the following command:

```bash
yarn start services-auth-ids-api
```
