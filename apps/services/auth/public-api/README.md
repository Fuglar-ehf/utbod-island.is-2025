## Public API Documentation

### About

This service enables external clients to query the list of available delegations.

### Getting Started

To set up and run the API locally, you have two options:

1. **Connect to the AWS Development Database** - Connect directly to the AWS development database.
2. **Run a Local Database Container** - Set up a database container locally as an alternative.

For detailed instructions on starting the database, please refer to the [Getting Started section in IDS API](../ids-api/README.md#getting-started).

Once the database is running, start the service with the following command:

```bash
yarn start services-auth-public-api
```
