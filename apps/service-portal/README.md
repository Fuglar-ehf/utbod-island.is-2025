# Service Portal

## About

The service portal is the user personal pages where it will be able to find all the information relative to itself, family, finances, applications and so on.

## URLs

- [Development] (http://localhost:4200)
- [Dev](https://beta.dev01.devland.is/minarsidur)
- [Staging](https://beta.staging01.devland.is/minarsidur)
- [Production](https://island.is/minarsidur)

## Getting started

Before running the service portal, you will need to setup the user-profile service. Follow [these steps](../services/user-profile/README.md#initial-setup) first.

You might need to setup x-road service.

```bash
sh ./scripts/run-xroad-proxy.sh
```

You can then proceed and start [the GraphQL API](../api/README.md#getting-started) and the service portal:

```bash
yarn start service-portal
```

## Docs

Start by reading about the [portal module system](../../libs/portals/core/README.md).

### Adding a module to the service portal

To add a new module to the service-portal, import and add it to the list defined in [modules.ts](./src/store/modules.ts):

```tsx
// other imports...
import { myNewModule } from '@island.is/service-portal/my-new-module'

export const modules: PortalModule[] = [
  // other modules...
  myNewModule,
]
```

### Declaring routes in the service portal

Declaring a new route for the service portal involves a few steps:

- Declare a path for the route
- Declare a route in the master navigation
- Implement the route based on the user's authorization scope and return it so it gets rendered into the navigation.

#### Declaring a path for a library

All Service Portal paths are declared as an enum in [paths.ts](../../libs/service-portal/core/src/lib/navigation/paths.ts)

#### Declare a route in the master navigation

The master navigation is defined in the service portal core in [masterNavigation.ts](../../libs/service-portal/core/src/lib/navigation/masterNavigation.ts)
Navigation items are defined as such:

```typescript
export interface PortalNavigationItem {
  name: MessageDescriptor | string
  path?: ServicePortalPath
  external?: boolean
  // System routes are always rendered in the navigation
  systemRoute?: boolean
  icon?: Pick<IconProps, 'icon' | 'type'>
  children?: PortalNavigationItem[]
}
```

#### Implement the route

Each module implements its own routes (see above). Routes should only be returned if available to the session scope. Items will be rendered into the navigation if a route has been declared for it.
