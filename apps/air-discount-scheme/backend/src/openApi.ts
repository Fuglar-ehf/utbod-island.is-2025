  This documentation is provided to airline booking sites for
  integration purposes.

  WARNING: While you are developing this integration the Discounts
  endpoint POST /api/public/users/{nationalId}/discounts is
  available to create a discount for any national id. We will
  remove it when we go live. This functionality of creating
  discounts should only be available to the user who is registered
  for it.

  If there exists an ID attribute on any object, that ID refers
  to a unique identifier of the object it is in. If the object
  has an additional ID, something like flightId that refers to
  an unique identifier of an object that is related to the
  current one.

  The flow is like this:

    1.  First create a discount through the
        POST /api/public/users/{nationalId}/discounts endpoint.
        Any valid nationalId will work. Notice the warning above
        about this endpoint.


    2.  Use the discount to book a flight on your end:

      2a. First you need to fetch the user that is registered to this
          discountCode by calling
          GET /api/public/discounts/{discountCode}/user.
          This endpoint will return user specific information that
          should be populated on your booking page and made readonly
          so the user can not change it.

      2b. Then you can create a flight. A flight contains all the
          relevant information about the booking from the customer.
          Use POST /api/public/discounts/{discountCode}/flights.
          When this endpoint is used the discountCode is
          invalidated, so the user can not use it and needs
          to generate a new discountCode (step 1).


    3.  When you have created a flight you have the possibility
        to delete it. For example if a payment failure has
        occurred. You can use the ID that you received when
        creating the flight to delete it. You have two possibilities:

      3a. You can either delete all related flightLegs that were
          booked by calling
          DELETE /api/public/flights/{flightId}

      3b. Or delete specific flightLegs within the booking by:

        3ba. First fetching the related flightLegs by calling
             GET /api/public/flights/{flightId}

        3bb. Then use the flightLeg IDs from "3ba." result
             to delete the desired flightLegs by calling
             DELETE /api/public/flights/{flightId}/flightLegs/{flightLegId}
