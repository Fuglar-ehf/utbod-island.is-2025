To enable SMS notifications to an on-call judge provide a password for the SMS service and court mobile numbers:

```bash
NOVA_PASSWORD=<SMS password> COURTS_MOBILE_NUMBERS='{ <court-id>: { mobileNumbers: <judge mobile number> } }' yarn start judicial-system-backend
```

Similarly, you can enable electronic signatures of judge rulings by providing a Dokobit access token: `DOKOBIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Dokobit access token>`

To enable email sending via AWS SES you can modify `emailOptions` in `environment.ts` as follows:

```typescript
emailOptions: {
  useTestAccount: false,
  options: {
    region: 'eu-west-1',
  },
},
```

You need to be authenticated against AWS for this to work. Alternatively, you can view ethereal nodemailer messages by following the urls shown in the logs.

To enable prison and prison administration email notifications provide email addresses: `PRISON_EMAIL=<prison email> PRISON_ADMIN_EMAIL=<prison administration email>`

```bash
yarn start judicial-system-api
```

You can enable communication with the court system via xRoad by providing appropriate values for the environment variables specified in the `xRoad` and `courtClientOptions` sections in `environment.ts`.
