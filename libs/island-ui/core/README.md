# Island UI

Island UI is a component library designed to offer a consistent UI/UX. This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for the Island UI Core, use the following command:

```bash
nx test island-ui-core
```

This will run the tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework.
