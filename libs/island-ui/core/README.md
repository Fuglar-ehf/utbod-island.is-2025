# Island UI

Island UI is a component library designed to offer a consistent UI/UX experience for developers. The library was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev), a smart, fast, and extensible build system.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for the Island UI Core, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project if necessary.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   nx test island-ui-core
   ```

This command will execute the tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure the reliability of your codebase.
