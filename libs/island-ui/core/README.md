# Island UI

Island UI is a component library designed to offer a consistent UI/UX experience for developers. This library was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev), a smart, fast, and extensible build system.

## Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests for the Island UI core components, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   nx test island-ui-core
   ```

This command will run the tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a comprehensive JavaScript testing framework that helps ensure the reliability of your codebase.
