# Skilavottord Types

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev), a smart, extendable build framework.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for the `skilavottord-types` library, use the following command:

```bash

This will run the tests using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test framework. Make sure you have the necessary configurations in place for Jest within your Nx workspace before running the tests.
