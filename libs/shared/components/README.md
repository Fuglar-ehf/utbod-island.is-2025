# Shared Components

This library contains Island.is components that can be shared across multiple projects and interfaces.

Unlike island-ui components, the components in this library may depend on the specific technical architecture of Island.is, such as our translation system, feature flags, authentication, GraphQL API, and more.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for this library using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), run the following command:
```
nx test shared-components
```
```
