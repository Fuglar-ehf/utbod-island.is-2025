# Form Fields Library

## Overview

This library provides form field components specifically designed for use within a [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) environment. It leverages UI components from the island-ui library to offer a cohesive and visually appealing user experience.

### Key Features

- **Integration with React Hook Form**: Seamlessly integrate the form fields with react-hook-form to simplify form handling in React applications.
- **Island-UI Components**: Utilizes island-ui components, ensuring consistency and visual harmony across your user interface.

### Installation

To use the form fields library, ensure you have installed the necessary dependencies:

1. **react-hook-form**: The primary form handling library.

   ```
   npm install react-hook-form
   ```

2. **island-ui**: The UI component library from which the form fields derive their styling and functionality.

   ```
   npm install island-ui
   ```

### Usage

Here's a basic example to illustrate how to use the form fields with react-hook-form and island-ui components:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useForm, Controller } from 'react-hook-form';
import { TextInput } from 'island-ui';

const MyForm = () => {
  const { control, handleSubmit } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <Controller
        name="example"
        control={control}
        defaultValue=""
        render={({ field }) => <TextInput {...field} />}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default MyForm;
```
