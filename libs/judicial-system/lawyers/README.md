# Judicial System Lawyers

This library is a component of the judicial system framework, developed with [Nx](https://nx.dev). It is designed to streamline operations concerning legal representatives within the judicial domain.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for this library, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
nx test judicial-system-lawyers
```

The tests will run using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript testing framework, to verify that your components are functioning as intended.
