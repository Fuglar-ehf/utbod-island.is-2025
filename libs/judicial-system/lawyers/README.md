# Judicial System Lawyers

This library is a component of the judicial system framework, developed with [Nx](https://nx.dev). It is designed to streamline operations concerning legal representatives within the judicial domain.

## Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests for this library, open your terminal and execute the following command:
