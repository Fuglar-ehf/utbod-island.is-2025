# Judicial System Lawyers

This library is a component of the Judicial System Framework, developed using [Nx](https://nx.dev). It is designed to streamline processes involving legal representatives within the judicial domain.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for this library, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
nx test judicial-system-lawyers
```

The tests use [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a JavaScript testing framework, to ensure that the components operate as intended.
