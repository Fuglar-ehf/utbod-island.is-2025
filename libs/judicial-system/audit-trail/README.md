# Judicial System Audit Trail

The Judicial System Audit Trail library is a crucial part of a larger application aimed at establishing a comprehensive audit trail within judicial systems. This library is generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev), which provides extensible development tools for monorepos.

## Running Unit Tests

Unit tests are available to verify the code quality and functionality. These tests are executed using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a widely-used JavaScript testing framework.

### Steps to Execute Unit Tests

1. Open your terminal.
2. Ensure you are in the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command to execute the unit tests:

   ```sh
   nx test judicial-system-audit-trail
   ```

This command leverages Jest to run all unit tests associated with the `judicial-system-audit-trail` library, providing feedback and results for any failed tests or detected issues.
