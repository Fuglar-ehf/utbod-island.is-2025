# Judicial System Audit Trail

This library is an integral component of a larger system, dedicated to maintaining an audit trail within judicial systems. It was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev), a set of extensible development tools for monorepos.

## Running Unit Tests

To ensure code quality and functionality, unit tests are provided. These can be executed using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript testing framework.

### Steps to Execute Unit Tests

1. Open your terminal.
2. Execute the following command to run the tests:

   ```sh
   nx test judicial-system-audit-trail
   ```

This command utilizes the Jest test runner to execute all tests associated with the `judicial-system-audit-trail` library, providing feedback and results for any failed tests or detected issues.
