# Judicial System Audit Trail

This library is an integral component of a larger system, dedicated to maintaining an audit trail within judicial systems. It was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev), a set of extensible development tools for monorepos.

## Running Unit Tests

To ensure code quality and functionality, unit tests are provided. These can be executed using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript testing framework.

### Steps to Execute Unit Tests

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project if you are not already there.
3. Execute the following command to run the tests:

   ```sh
   nx test judicial-system-audit-trail
   ```

This command utilizes Jest to run all unit tests associated with the `judicial-system-audit-trail` library, offering feedback and results for any failed tests or detected issues.
