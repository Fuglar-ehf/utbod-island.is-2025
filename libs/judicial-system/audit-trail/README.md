# Judicial System Audit Trail

The Judicial System Audit Trail library is a vital component of a larger application designed to establish a comprehensive audit trail within judicial systems. This library is built using [Nx](https://nx.dev), which offers extensible development tools for monorepos.

## Running Unit Tests

Unit tests are available to ensure the code's quality and functionality. These tests are conducted using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a popular JavaScript testing framework.

### Steps to Execute Unit Tests

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Execute the following command to run the unit tests:

   ```sh
   nx test judicial-system-audit-trail
   ```
````

This command utilizes Jest to run all unit tests associated with the `judicial-system-audit-trail` library, providing feedback on results, including any failed tests or detected issues.

```

```
