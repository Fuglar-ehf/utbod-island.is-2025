# Judicial System Audit Trail

This library is an integral part of a larger system, focusing on maintaining an audit trail within judicial systems. It was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev), a set of extensible development tools.

## Running Unit Tests

To ensure code quality and functionality, unit tests are provided. You can run these tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript testing framework.

### Steps to Execute Unit Tests:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to execute the tests:

   ```sh
   nx test judicial-system-audit-trail
   ```

This command will trigger the Jest test runner to execute all tests associated with the `judicial-system-audit-trail` library, providing feedback on any failed tests or issues detected.
