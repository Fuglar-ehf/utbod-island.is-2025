# Shared Authentication Code Library

This library is designed to encapsulate common authentication code that can be utilized across various projects. This library is versatile and can be implemented in both client-side and server-side environments.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrate authentication mechanisms for both client and server applications.
- **Reusable Components**: Share authentication functions to reduce code duplication and maintain consistent security practices across projects.
- **Ease of Integration**: Designed for straightforward integration, enabling quick implementation and testing.

## Usage

### Client-Side Integration

1. **Add the Library**: Include the library in your project's client-side environment using a package manager or by directly importing it.
2. **Invoke Authentication Methods**: Utilize the provided methods to handle user authentication, such as login and token management.
3. **Manage Responses**: Handle server responses to complete authentication workflows.

### Server-Side Integration

1. **Install the Library**: Include the library in your server environment, using a package manager or by direct download.
2. **Implement Security Protocols**: Use the shared code to enforce authentication protocols, like verifying tokens and user credentials.
3. **Handle Client Requests**: Process incoming requests using the standardized authentication flows.

## Best Practices

- **Consistent Updates**: Regularly update the library to incorporate the latest security patches and improvements.
- **Monitor for Issues**: Actively monitor and test the authentication flows in both client and server environments.
- **Secure Configuration**: Ensure all authentication configurations are securely set to prevent vulnerabilities.
