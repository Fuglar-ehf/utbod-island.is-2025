# License Library

The License Library is designed to provide common license information for services related to licensing. This library was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev), a powerful set of tools for managing and generating projects.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for this library, use the following command:

```shell
nx test license
```

This will run the tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity and support for a variety of testing styles.
