# Clients University Application - University of Akureyri

This library is part of the Clients University Application for the University of Akureyri. It was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev), a set of extensible DevTools for monorepos, which helps developers to build, test, and scale applications efficiently.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for this library, use the following command:

```bash
nx test clients-university-application-university-of-akureyri
```

This command runs the tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed and your environment is properly set up before running tests. For additional information on setting up your testing environment using Jest within an Nx workspace, refer to the official [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) and [Nx testing guide](https://nx.dev/latest/angular/workspace/testing).
