## Introduction

Auth Clients are used to handle authentication logic within an application. They enable applications to securely authenticate users and manage user sessions.

## Setting Up Auth Clients

To set up an auth client, follow these steps:

1. Choose a suitable authentication provider.
2. Install required libraries or modules for your chosen provider.
3. Initialize the auth client in your application.

## Configuring Auth Clients

After setting up your auth client, configure it as follows:

1. Obtain necessary credentials from your authentication provider (client ID, client secret, etc.).
2. Set up redirect URLs.
3. Configure scopes and permissions appropriate for your application.

## Using Auth Clients

Once configured, you can use auth clients to:

- Authenticate users.
- Verify token validity.
- Manage user sessions.
- Authorize API requests.

### Example Code

Below is a basic example of using an auth client:

```python
from auth_provider import AuthClient

# Initialize the auth client
auth_client = AuthClient(client_id='your_client_id', client_secret='your_client_secret')

# Authenticate a user
user_token = auth_client.authenticate(username='user', password='pass')

# Verify the token
is_valid = auth_client.verify_token(user_token)
```

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. **Invalid Credentials Error**: Ensure that the client ID and client secret are correctly configured.
2. **Redirection Issues**: Check that the redirect URLs are correctly set in both your application and the auth provider's console.
3. **Scope Errors**: Double-check that the required scopes are enabled for your application.

## FAQs

- **What is an auth client?**

  An auth client is a component that manages authentication processes between an application and an authentication provider.

- **Why do I need to configure redirect URLs?**

  Redirect URLs are used by auth providers to send responses back to your application after a user authenticates successfully.

This documentation should serve as a guide to effectively implement and manage auth clients within your application.
