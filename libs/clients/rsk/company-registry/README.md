# Clients Company Registry

The Clients Company Registry allows interaction with two primary endpoints:

- Fetching Company information by national ID.
- Conducting a Company information search.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests, run the following command:

```
nx test clients-rsk-company-info
```

This will execute the unit tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
