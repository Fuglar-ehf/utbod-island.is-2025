# clients-social-insurance-administration

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev)

There is a backwards compability hack in the `generateBackwardsCompatibleModel.yaml`. The updated api doesn't provide any input DTO's so we create our own with the `.yaml`

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test clients-social-insurance-administration` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
