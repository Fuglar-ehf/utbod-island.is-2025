# Smart Solutions

A library enabling interaction with various digital licenses. This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Usage

To use the module, import it and call the `registerAsync` function. This allows you to leverage the `ConfigModule` to inject the appropriate parameters, depending on the caller's configuration.

The calling module must provide a factory function that returns the configuration object. This permits both dynamic usage of the module and dynamic creation of the configuration.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `nx test clients-smartsolutions` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Running Lint

Run `nx lint clients-smartsolutions` to execute the linting process via [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
