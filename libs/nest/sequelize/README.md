This library includes reusable settings for Sequelize, the modern TypeScript and Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for this library, use the command `nx test nest-sequelize`. This will run the tests via the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) testing framework.
