# Regulations

This documentation outlines the types, components, and helper utilities designed for managing Regulations (Regluger√∞ir) across different parts of the monorepo.

Some utilities contained within may have more general application, though they are currently exclusively utilized by Regulations-related sections of the monorepo. These utilities may be relocated to other libraries in the future. Refactoring will be addressed as needed.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), run the following command:
```

nx test regulations

```

```
