This document details the Notifications API Domain, outlining its components, features, and usage instructions. It serves as a guide for developers implementing or consuming the Notifications API.

## Overview

The Notifications API is designed to manage and handle notifications across various platforms and devices. It provides a unified interface to send, receive, and manage notifications efficiently and effectively.

## Key Features

## API Endpoints

The API provides a set of endpoints to manage notifications. Each endpoint follows RESTful principles and returns data in JSON format.

### Endpoint: `/notifications/send`

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

- **200 OK**: The request has succeeded.
- **201 Created**: A new resource has been created successfully.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed or was not provided.
- **404 Not Found**: The specified resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server.

## Best Practices

- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Implement authentication to secure endpoints.
- Validate input data to prevent errors and injection attacks.
- Use descriptive error messages to aid in debugging.
