# API Domains Finance

This API utilises the [`financeService`](/libs/clients/finance/src/lib/FinanceClientService.ts).

## How to use

Start the API:

```bash
yarn start api
```

X-road needs to be running:

```bash
./scripts/run-xroad-proxy.sh
# or
kubectl -n socat port-forward svc/socat-xroad 8081:80
```

Finance API should now be available to use within √çsland.is.

## UI

Example of usage can be found in: <http://localhost:4200/minarsidur/fjarmal>

Service portal needs to be running.
`yarn start service-portal`

## Mocking

The data for finance API has been mocked, for mock usage and testing purposes try the API_MOCKS.

Add `API_MOCKS=true` to your `.env` file and make sure it is available in your webpack browser bundles ([Next.js example](../../../apps/web/next.config.js)).

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test api-domains-finance` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
