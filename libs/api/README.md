# Documentation

## Overview
This documentation provides essential information about the API library and its operational scope. It offers insights into the tags used for classification and organization purposes.

## Tags Description
- **lib:api**: Indicates that the content is related to a library that provides an API. This tag is used to categorize and identify resources, functions, or documentation that pertain to the API library aspect.

- **scope:api**: Refers to the operational boundaries and limits within which the API functions. It defines the range of actions, data access, and interactions that the API is designed to handle.

## Usage
When documenting or categorizing resources, apply the tags appropriately to ensure consistency and clarity. This assists in ensuring that users can quickly find relevant information according to their topics of interest.

## Best Practices
- Always provide a concise and meaningful description of each tag.
- Use code or JSON snippets to show real examples of tag applications.
- Regularly review and update the tags to reflect any changes in the API's functionality or its intended use.
