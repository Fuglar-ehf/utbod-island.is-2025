# Auth API Library Documentation

This library provides services and models used by the IdentityServer (IdS) backend APIs, including the IdS administration APIs. It is designed to streamline the integration and management of authentication and authorization processes within applications.

## Overview

- **Services**: Core functionality provided by the library to facilitate interaction with IdentityServer.
- **Models**: Predefined data structures that represent requests and responses in the IdS backend APIs.

## Key Components

### Services

The services within this library enable:

1. **User Authentication**: Validating user credentials and managing login sessions.
2. **Token Management**: Handling the issuance, renewal, and revocation of access tokens.
3. **User Management**: CRUD operations for user accounts, roles, and permissions.
4. **OAuth/OIDC Flows**: Implementing standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect flows.

### Models

The models encapsulate data types used in:

- **Authentication Requests and Responses**: Structures defining login and token exchange payloads.
- **User Data Management**: Entities representing user information, roles, and permissions.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error response formats for consistent error messaging.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Integration**: To use this library, integrate it into your application where authentication and authorization are handled.
- **Configuration**: Ensure proper setup of IdentityServer to align with the services and models offered by this library.
- **Security**: Follow best practices for securing user data and managing access controls using the features of this library.

## Best Practices

- **Maintain Updated Documentation**: Keep this documentation current with any updates to the library features.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling based on the provided error models.
- **Secure Tokens**: Always ensure tokens are transmitted over secure channels (HTTPS) and stored securely.

## Conclusion

The Auth API Library is a robust solution for managing authentication and authorization with IdentityServer. It simplifies integrating these processes into your applications, ensuring a secure and efficient user management system.
