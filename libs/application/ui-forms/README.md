# Application UI Forms

This library includes reusable form builder components for the application system.

## How to Create a New Form

To create a reusable form builder component, follow these steps:

1. **Select an Element**: Choose any element from the form builder library to start constructing your form.

2. **Build the Form**: Use the selected elements to design your form structure as per the application requirements.

3. **Integrate Data Schema**: Ensure that each form includes a defined data schema that represents the formâ€™s data structure and constraints.

4. **Add Translations**: If applicable, provide translations for messages to support different languages. This enhances the form's usability in multilingual contexts.

By following these steps, you can create new forms efficiently, ensuring consistency and reusability across the application system.
