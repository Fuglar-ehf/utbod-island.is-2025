## 1. Introduction

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another. This report aims to document the inheritance structures prevalent within the codebase, offering insights into class relationships and design patterns.

## 2. Class Definitions

### BaseClass

- **Description**: Serves as the root class from which other classes inherit.
- **Properties**:
  - `property1`: An example property with a brief description.
  - `property2`: Another example property with a brief description.
- **Methods**:
  - `method1()`: Description of what this method does.
  - `method2()`: Description of what this method does.

### DerivedClass

- **Description**: Inherits from BaseClass and extends its functionality.
- **Properties**:
  - `additionalProperty`: Additional property unique to DerivedClass.
- **Methods**:
  - `additionalMethod()`: Description of what this method does.

## 3. Inheritance Hierarchies

### Simple Inheritance

```plaintext
BaseClass
└── DerivedClass
```

- **Explanation**: DerivedClass extends BaseClass, inheriting its properties and methods while adding new ones specific to DerivedClass.

### Multiple Inheritance

(Not applicable; include section if the codebase supports it.)

- **Structure**:

```plaintext
ClassA
└── ClassC

ClassB
└── ClassC
```

- **Explanation**: ClassC inherits from both ClassA and ClassB, combining their functionalities.

## 4. Use Cases

- **Code Reusability**: Inheritance promotes reuse of existing code, reducing duplication.
- **Extensibility**: Allows for creating complex systems that can be extended by adding new derived classes without modifying existing code.

## 5. Conclusion

Understanding inheritance structures is crucial for maintaining and extending complex codebases. This report highlights the primary inheritance hierarchies and demonstrates how existing classes can be extended effectively through inheritance.
