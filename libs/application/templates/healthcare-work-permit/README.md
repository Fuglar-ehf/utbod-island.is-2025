## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for this library, use the following command:

nx test application-templates-healthcare-work-permit
```

This command utilizes [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as the test runner for executing the unit tests. Jest is a delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue.js, and Svelte.

Remember to configure your Jest settings in the `jest.config.js` file found at the root of your Nx workspace to suit your project's needs.
