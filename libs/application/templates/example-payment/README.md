# Application Templates Example Payment

This is a demo application intended to serve as a reference for developers working on applications within the application system. It is designed to provide testing grounds for handling payments in their respective applications.

There are several components involved when managing payments. We provide a comprehensive guide on implementing payments in applications: [Application Payment Guide](/handbook/misc/application-payment-guide.md).

This demo serves as the essential link for developers by providing an example they can refer to, experiment with, and compare against.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests, run the following command: 

```bash
nx test application-templates-example-payment
```

This command utilizes [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for testing.
