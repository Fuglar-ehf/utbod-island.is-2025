# Application Templates: Transport Authority - Change Operator of Vehicle

This library is part of the application templates for the Transport Authority, specifically dealing with changing the operator of a vehicle. The library was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev), a powerful toolkit to build scalable applications.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for this library, use the following command:

```bash
nx test application-templates-transport-authority-change-operator-of-vehicle
```

This command runs the unit tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript testing framework.

For additional information on using Jest and configuring Nx for testing, please refer to the documentation for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) and [Nx Testing](https://nx.dev/latest/node/core/testing).
