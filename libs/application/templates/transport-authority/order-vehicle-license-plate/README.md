# Application Templates: Transport Authority Order Vehicle License Plate

This is a library focused on managing the ordering of vehicle license plates through a transport authority interface.

## Generated with Nx

The library was built using the [Nx](https://nx.dev) framework, a set of extensible tools for monorepo development, which facilitates building scalable applications.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests for this library, run the following command:

```bash
nx test application-templates-transport-authority-order-vehicle-license-plate
```

This will trigger the test suite powered by [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Nx installed and properly configured in your development environment to successfully run the unit tests. For more information about setting up Nx, refer to the [Nx documentation](https://nx.dev).

### Testing Best Practices

- Ensure that your tests cover various edge cases to maintain robustness.
- Regularly update the test cases to reflect any changes in the application logic.
- Use descriptive test names to clearly indicate what each test is validating.

By following these practices, you can maintain high code quality and reliability for your application.
