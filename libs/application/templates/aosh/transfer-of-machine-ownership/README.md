# Application Templates - AOSH Transfer of Machine Ownership

This library is a template for managing the transfer of machine ownership within the AOSH system. It was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev), a toolkit for monorepo development.

## Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests for this library, use the following command:

```bash
nx test application-templates-aosh-transfer-of-machine-ownership
```

This command executes the unit tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a delightful JavaScript testing framework.

Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed and the appropriate environment configured before running the tests.
