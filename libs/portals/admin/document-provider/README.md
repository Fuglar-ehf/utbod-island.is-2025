# Document Provider

## Overview

This module serves as a management portal specifically designed for Document Providers. Within this portal, providers can:

- Access and review statistics pertaining to their documents.
- Manage the categories and types associated with their documents.
- Configure various settings, including specifying the API endpoint where documents are served.

### Document Providers

Document Providers are entities responsible for sending document references to the mailbox on island.is. They ensure the provision of documents from their servers upon request. Importantly, documents are not stored on island.is' servers.

## Work in Progress

This module is intended to eventually be part of the institutions service portal. However, since the development of the institutions service portal has not yet commenced, the module is temporarily placed under the navigation bar in "Mínar síður." Access to this section is restricted to a select group of users, managed through hard-coded national IDs as an interim solution.
