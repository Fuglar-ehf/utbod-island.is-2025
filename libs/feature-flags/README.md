# Feature Flags

This library serves as a low-level wrapper for the feature flag service currently implemented by **Island.is**.

For high-level libraries, you may want to explore the following options:

- [`@island.is/react/feature-flags`](../react/feature-flags/README.md)
- [`@island.is/nest/feature-flags`](../nest/feature-flags/README.md)

> **Warning:**  
> Feature flagging is a technique used to softly launch "beta ready" features to a specific group of users.  
> It should not be used to conceal features that are still a work in progress from all users.
