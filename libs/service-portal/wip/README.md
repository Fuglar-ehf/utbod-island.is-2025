# Service Portal Wip

Use this library as a placeholder module for modules that are upcoming/work in progress.
An example could be a module with a feature-flag that is hidden behind the feature-flag for the user. Then this would be a place where you could put a single "skeleton" page and a link in the sidebar to show the user that feature is upcoming, without hitting the feature-flag.
