## Usage

To display the list of applications, you need to run the `application-system-api`. Additionally, you can run the `application-system-form` to open the applications in their respective forms.

To do this, first run the API:

```bash
yarn start application-system-api
```

Then, run the form:

```bash
yarn start application-system-form
```

You will then be able to access it at `localhost:4242`.
