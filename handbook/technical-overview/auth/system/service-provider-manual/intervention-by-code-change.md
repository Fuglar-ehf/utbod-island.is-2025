# Intervention by code change

If a fault is diagnosed which needs code change then the software support should follow these guidelines:

1. \**\*\*Retrieve the version of the system which is currently on *Prod\*.
2. \*\*\*\*Fix the bug.
3. \**\*\*Commit changes to the *Dev\*environment.
4. \**\*\*Test the bug-fix on *Dev\*.
5. \**\*\*If the bug is fixed and all tests are successful, then request a release of the fixed version on *Staging-\*environment.
6. \**\*\*If tests succeed on *Staging* then a third-party will release the new version on *Prod-\*environment.
