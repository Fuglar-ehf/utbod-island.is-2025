# AWS Secrets

## Prerequisites

- You will need [AWS command line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed.
- You will also need access to the AWS account. Ask someone from DevOps to send you an invitation.

## Getting started

### Using AWS SSO

Using SSO is the most straight forward solution. You won't need to go by yourself on your AWS account and it will open the needed url for you.

1. Run the sso command for the first time

```bash
aws configure sso

SSO start URL [None]: https://island-is.awsapps.com/start
SSO Region [None]: eu-west-1
```

Then choose the environnement of your choice. Likely to be `island-is-development01`. You will be prompted for the following:

```md
CLI default client Region [eu-west-1]: <Press Enter>
CLI default output format [json]: <Press Enter>
CLI profile name [AWSPowerUserAccess-X]: <Custom name (e.g. dev)> or <Press Enter>
```

This step will add the new profile to your `~/.aws/config` file. If you choose `dev` as profile's name, you will see `[profile dev]` in there.

2. Ready to use

You can now pass your profile to the `get-secrets` script.

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=<profile-name> yarn get-secrets <project-name> # e.g. profile-name -> dev as seen above
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Refresh your profile:** The SSO credentials only lasts 8 hours, after which AWS commands start failing. You can run the following command to renew your SSO credentials.

```bash
aws configure sso --profile <profile-name> # e.g. profile-name -> dev as seen above
```

It will open the browser, go to your AWS account to log in and will refresh your credentials and you are ready to use the AWS commands again.
{% endhint %}

### Using AWS session

This method is more manual where you will need to export environments variables or change a file by yourself.

You will need to go to your [AWS account](https://island-is.awsapps.com/start) and get the required credentials for the account you need.

1. Option 1: Set environment variables

You can copy/paste these environment variables to your terminal:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_EXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_EXAMPLE
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=AWS_SESSION_TOKEN_EXAMPLE
```

2. Option 2: Edit `~/.aws/credentials`

Copy/paste the values in the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

```bash
[X_AWSPowerUserAccess]
aws_access_key_id = <KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <ACCESS_KEY>
aws_session_token = <SESSION_TOKEN>
```

3. Ready to use

In this case you won't need to pass a profile name as opposed to the SSO method.

```bash
yarn get-secrets <project-name>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Refresh your profile:** The session token only lasts 1 hour, after which AWS commands start failing. You will need to log in to your AWS account and get new credentials, with one of the above methods.
{% endhint %}

## Usage to fetch secrets

You should now be able to fetch secrets for the project you need.

**With SSO**

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=<profile-name> yarn get-secrets <project> [options]
```

**Without SSO**

```bash
yarn get-secrets <project> [options]
```

**Example**:

```bash
yarn get-secrets api
```

You can verify it by opening the `.env.secret` file at the root, or inside your code using for example:

```typescript
const { MY_SECRET_KEY } = process.env
```

You can also add the `--reset` argument to the command, that will reset the .env.secret file.

### Troubleshoot

If you get the following error message, you will need to refresh your credentials as explained above.

```bash
An error occurred (ExpiredTokenException) when calling the GetParametersByPath operation: The security token included in the request is expired
```

## Usage to create secrets

You can run the following command and will be prompted for input.

```bash
yarn create-secret
```

You will be asked for a _secret name_ that will be added to the `/k8s/` secrets namespace, a _secret value_ and the _secret type_ (`SecureString` or `String`).

### Example

```bash
âžœ yarn create-secret

Secret name: /k8s/my-app/MY_APP_KEY
# Name: Ok!
# Length: Ok!

Secret value: a-very-secure-secret
# Length: Ok!

SecureString [Y/n]? # [enter] for SecureString
# SecureString selected

Add tags? [y/N]? # [enter] to skip creating tags

Example: Key=Foo,Value=Bar Key=Another,Value=Tag: # note: Key and Value are case sensitive! Create multiple tags by separating with whitespace.

Are you sure [Y/n]? # [enter] to confirm
# Creating secret....
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It's recommended to use `SecureString` in most cases. However, if you need to add an email address, or an email sender's name to the secrets, you can just use a `String`.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only alphanumeric characters, `/` and `-` are allowed. The length of the _secret name_ should be from 6-128 characters long.
{% endhint %}

## Making dev secrets available locally

Environment variables that should not be tracked but needed locally should be added to the `.env.secret` file. _(**NOTE:** Each variable must be prefixed with `export ` for direnv to pick them up.)_

Additionally, if that same variable is also stored in AWS Parameter Store, the secret can be labeled with the `dev` label from `History` -> `Attach labels`.

All secrets labeled with the `dev` label can be fetched using `yarn get-secrets <project>`.
